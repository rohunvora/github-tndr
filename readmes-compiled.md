# Arena Refs

**Turn your visual taste into AI-readable rules.**

You collect references in Are.na. This system converts them into structured guidance that makes AI coding assistants (Cursor, Claude, etc.) build interfaces that match your aesthetic.

## 🚀 Live Component Gallery

**Live**: [site-qhre0qj0j-rohun-voras-projects.vercel.app](https://site-qhre0qj0j-rohun-voras-projects.vercel.app)

Your Are.na saves → structured, replicable components → **live-rendered design system**.

### What's New: Live Rendering

Components are no longer just screenshots with metadata. They're **rendered live** using extracted design tokens:

- **Live Hero Compositions** — see each component rendered with its actual colors, typography, shadows, and spacing
- **Interactive Atom Previews** — buttons you can hover, surfaces with real gradients, typography at true scale
- **No Screenshots First** — the reference image is tucked away; you see the *implementation* first

### Features

- **26 components** extracted with AI from UI/UX channel
- **104 atoms** (buttons, surfaces, cards, typography) live-rendered and copyable
- **8 aesthetic families** (Flat Minimal, Soft Gradient, Dark Premium, etc.)
- **Copy-paste CSS** for every component and atom
- **Export** to `.cursorrules`, CSS variables, or Tailwind config
- **Dark mode** with refined typography (IBM Plex Sans/Mono)

### Quick Start: Extract Your Own Components

# Ship or Kill Bot 🚀☠️

**AI-powered Telegram bot that analyzes your GitHub repos and tells you whether to ship, focus, or kill each project.**

Stop letting half-finished projects rot in your GitHub. This bot scans your repositories, identifies what's actually valuable, and gives you brutally honest recommendations: ship it as-is, cut to the core feature, or kill it entirely.

## Commands

### 📊 Analysis
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/repo <name>` | Analyze a GitHub repo (ship/cut/kill verdict) |
| `/scan` | Batch analyze all repos from last N days |
| **Send photo** | Analyze chart image for support/resistance zones |

### 🎨 Generation
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/preview <repo>` | Generate cover image → approve → add to README |
| `/readme <repo>` | Generate/optimize README |

### 🎴 Feed
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/next` | Carousel of active projects — pick what to work on |
| `/status` | See repo counts by state |

  </p>

> **⚠️ Status: Unreviewed**
> 
> The new `cursorhabits/` CLI package was just built and I haven't had time to review how it actually works or test it properly. **Next step: fully try it out, rip it apart, and validate it works as expected.** Use at your own risk until this notice is removed.

## The Problem

You use Cursor daily. You've said things like this **dozens** of times:

> "Push to GitHub when you're done"  
> "Don't test locally, deploy to Vercel"  
> "Always check mobile"  
> "Add that key to .env"

But you never formalize these into rules because:
- You can't remember them all in the moment
- Writing rules from scratch feels arbitrary
- You don't know what you *actually* repeat vs. what you *think* you repeat

**Your chat history already knows.** This tool extracts it.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: pip install (recommended)

```bash
pip install cursorhabits
cursorhabits
```

### Option 2: Run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohunvora/prmpt-hstry.git
cd prmpt-hstry/cursorhabits
pip install -e .

```

That's it. No API keys required, no accounts, no data uploaded anywhere.

# cursor-habits

**Turn your Cursor chat history into personalized rules — automatically.**

Stop repeating yourself. Let your past conversations teach Cursor how you like to work.

## The Problem

You use Cursor daily. You've said things like this *dozens* of times:

> "Push to GitHub when you're done"
> "Don't test locally, deploy to Vercel"  
> "Always check mobile"
> "Add that key to .env"

But you never formalize these into rules because:
- You can't remember them all in the moment
- Writing rules from scratch feels arbitrary
- You don't know what you *actually* repeat vs. what you *think* you repeat

**Your chat history knows.** This tool extracts it.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

# Buyback Tracker

**Real-time leaderboard tracking crypto protocols that actually buy back their tokens from the market.**

Unlike most DeFi protocols that just distribute fees to stakers, this tracks the rare protocols with verified buyback programs—where the protocol actively purchases tokens from the open market. Get P/E ratios, buyback yields, and trend data for protocols like Hyperliquid, pump.fun, Maker, and Aave that are actually reducing token supply through market purchases.

**🔗 Live App:** [rev-agg.vercel.app](https://rev-agg.vercel.app)

## What It Does

- **Curated Buyback List** — Only protocols with verified market buyback mechanisms (not fee distribution)
- **Real-time Metrics** — P/E ratios, buyback yields, 7-day trends updated every 30 seconds
- **Revenue Comparison** — See top revenue generators and which ones have buyback programs
- **Market Analysis** — Compare buyback efficiency across protocols with standardized metrics

## Key Features

### 📊 Dual Dashboard View

**Buybacks Tab**
- Verified protocols that buy tokens from open market
- P/E ratios based on buyback amounts vs market cap
- Annualized buyback yield as % of market cap
- 7-day buyback and price trend indicators

**Revenue Tab**
- Top 30 protocols by daily revenue
- 🔄 Badge indicates which have buyback programs
- Sortable by daily revenue, 7d change, 30

# Belief Router

> Chart analysis that's actually verifiable.

Paste a chart screenshot. Get support/resistance levels backed by visual AI analysis, not guesses. Every analysis includes clear invalidation rules and decision frameworks.

This isn't ChatGPT with a system prompt—it's a specialized tool for traders who want consistency and verification.

## Features

- **Chart Analysis** — Drop a screenshot, get structured technical analysis in seconds
- **AI-Annotated Charts** — Zones automatically drawn on your chart with Gemini's image generation
- **Consistent Output** — Same structured format every time (regime, levels, scenarios, invalidation)
- **Decision Framework** — Every analysis includes entry confirmations and invalidation rules
- **Follow-up Chat** — Ask questions about the analysis with full context preserved

## How It Works

```
Upload chart → AI extracts story + levels → Zones drawn on chart → Structured output
```

The analysis always includes:
1. **Story** — What happened on this chart, told like you're explaining to a friend
2. **Regime** — Current market state (uptrend, downtrend, range, breakout, breakdown)
3. **Key Zones** — Up to 4 support/resistance levels with strength ratings
4. **Scenarios** — Bullish and bearish "if/then" conditionals
5. **Invalidation** — Clear rules for when the thesis is wrong

* Live token counter
* JSON `STATUS|…` messages for machine consumption (used by the VS Code extension)
* Decorator `@track_agent` for one-liner integration
* Pure-Python, **no external dependencies**

## Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Install from source (PyPI publication coming later)
pip install -e cursor-eta-indicator

# 2. Use in your agent code
from cursor_eta import track_agent

@track_agent(steps=5, duration=20.0)
def my_agent():
    ...

my_agent()

# 3. Optional – show status in VS Code
a) cd cursor-eta-indicator/vscode-extension
b) npm install && npm run package
c) code --install-extension cursor-eta-*.vsix
```

Run the built-in demo:
```bash

**Photo-proof habit tracking with AI meal analysis for real accountability**

Stop lying to yourself about your habits. Habit Snapper requires photo evidence to verify habit completion - you can't just check a box, you have to actually do the thing and prove it. Built-in AI analyzes your meal photos for nutritional content, turning your food logs into actionable insights.

## What It Does

- **Photo-Required Verification**: Submit photo proof for every habit completion - workouts, meals, meditation, anything
- **AI Meal Analysis**: Automatically analyze meal photos for calories, macros, and nutritional content
- **Visual Progress Tracking**: See your consistency through heatmaps and calendar views
- **Accountability Through Evidence**: Can't fake it - the camera doesn't lie
- **Habit History**: Review your proof photos and track long-term patterns

## Why Photo Proof Works

Traditional habit trackers rely on the honor system. Habit Snapper eliminates self-deception by requiring visual evidence. When you know you'll need to take a photo, you're more likely to actually complete the habit - and complete it properly.

<p><strong>Auto-generates branded completion certificates for Whop course creators when students finish lessons.</strong></p>

# Certified — Auto-issue Certificates for Whop Courses

**Automatically generate branded completion certificates when students finish your Whop courses.** Solves the #1 requested feature in Courses app reviews with zero manual work — just connect your webhook and certificates appear instantly when lessons are completed.

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://whp-app.vercel.app/

## What It Does

- **Webhook Automation** — Listens to Whop course completion events and triggers certificate generation
- **Template Management** — Create branded certificate designs through a visual editor
- **Student Experience** — Auto-generated gallery where students view and download their certificates
- **Public Verification** — Shareable URLs to verify certificate authenticity
- **Course Control** — Toggle certificate generation per course, backfill for existing completions

## Why Use This

Course creators consistently request automated certificates, but building the webhook → PDF pipeline is complex. This handles the entire flow: webhook processing, template rendering, PDF generation, student delivery, and verification — all automatically.

## Architecture

# Catalysts

**Real-time catalyst detection system that explains why Solana tokens are pumping or dumping with structured event cards.**

Catalysts transforms chaotic crypto market movements into structured insights. Instead of just showing price charts, it generates "catalyst cards" - AI-powered explanations of token price movements linked to on-chain events, whale activity, and social signals. Each catalyst includes severity ratings, time horizons, evidence links, and directional bias to help you understand *why* tokens move, not just *that* they moved.

**⚠️ Status: Learning project (abandoned) - code available for reference**

## What It Does

- **Real-time monitoring** of Solana tokens for significant price movements
- **Catalyst card generation** - structured explanations of why tokens pump/dump
- **Multi-source correlation** - links on-chain events, social activity, and market data
- **AI-powered narratives** using Grok/xAI to explain complex market events
- **Severity classification** - HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW impact with time horizon predictions

## Catalyst Card Format

Each catalyst follows a structured data model:

```typescript
{
  token: "PEPE",
  type: "whale_movement",
  severity: "HIGH",
  timeHorizon: "SHORT_TERM",
  direction: "BEARISH",
  narrative: "Large holder transferred 2.5M tokens to Binance...",
